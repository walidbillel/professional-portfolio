                                           # Personal Portfolio 
                                          
    Personal website interface built with `Reactjs` and `Expressjs`. The App is wrapped with a Router leading to four pages (4routes): Main Page, Home, Portfolio, and Contact. Mongo DB is used to store all messages sent by the website visitors on the contact page. 
    
                                          ## Setting up and Running the app   
    
    - First of all, cloning the repository by copying the link and running `git clone 'URL'`.
    
    - `cd` your way into the directory, then install all dependencies including the client side ones by running `npm install` and `yarn add` on the client side. 
    
    - run `yarn start` and it will start both development environments, Reactjs and the Express server. You can add anything you want and play around with it.
